### JSON data chosen
I chose to use all data sets and create a university portal styled webpage.

### Brief description of web page developed (~150 words)
This webpage acts as a university hub that gives access to the university's student records, library directory, meal hall menu and nearby weather information. It contains 5 Javascript files, 4 of which that contain data pertaining to each categroy mentioned above through JSON objects. The fifth JS file contains a method to generate an html table given an array of JSON data. It also contains event listeners for each category's button to switch between data, and an event listener that triggers on input of the search bar to filter the table's data. The filtering shows the rows with the closest match from left to right first, then shows the rows that contains the users input after.

Switching between categories, filtering the data by entering keywords, and performing a mix of these two actions would be a good way to test the functionality of the webpage and also performing them in a mobile view.

I assumed that it was okay for the table to be horizontally scrollable in mobile view.
